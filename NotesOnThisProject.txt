Files required to generate a shared library on top of ROOT using CMake:
    - Headers and sources (keep both in the project source, CMakeLists is defined according to that).
    - CMakeLists (in the project root).
    - ${PROJECT}_LinkDef.h (in the project root).

    - It's easier if a shell script is used to build and install the project.


Make sure to include a ClassDef(MyClass, Version#) in headers and ClassImp(MyClass) in sources.
This is very important.


Header files:
    - Define all the headers using #ifndef and #endif, #pragma once doesn't work for ROOT somehow.
    I don't know why. Otherwise ROOT sessions don't recognize project headers.


CMakeLists:
    - Write this file very carefully and extremely precisely. This is a common place you can mess up.
    - Set minimum cmake version.
    - Set a PACKAGE name to the project - this will be helpfull.
    - Find root - of course required.
    - Set headers and sources (set separately).
    - Create the shared library. Include both sources and headers.
    - Generate the root dictionary using ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY. 
    - Configure and link against root.
        target_include_directories -> ensures rootcling find headers.
        target_link_libraries -> target build.

    - Then install.

    - Use the V1720 CMakeLists.txt as a template. It works fine.


After configuring CMakeLists you can build.
    - When configuring the make file using cmake command, specify both -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$INSTALL_DIR" 
    and -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH="$INSTALL_DIR"/lib. Second argument is to export the library path after library
    generation (You can add these to the shell script or manually do later after installation).
